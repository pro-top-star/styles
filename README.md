# What is Fundamental UI?

Fundamental UI(Beta) is a unified, flexible design system and pattern library package. It solves complex UI/UX
problems in a meaningful way and creates a simple intuitive experience. The package includes CSS and HTML markup for individual components that are technology agnostic.


# The Product Structure

* dist - distribution folder that contains combined and individual CSS files for all component
* docs - Static Documentation site for the library
* icons - Custom icon set that is used in some components
* ops - various configurations and gulp tasks for processing scss, building icons, generating documentation site
* scss - SCSS source files for all the components
* test - Testing framework for the components


# Project Requirements

This project packages the library for `npm` and generates the documentation as a static website.

We rely on several core technologies.

* Git (for downloading this repo)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (minimum v6.4)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) (for various ops tasks)
* SCSS (for CSS)
* Nunjucks (for testing)
* Ruby (for documentation site)
* Bundle (for documentation site)
* Jekyll (for documentation site)

```html
<link href="node_modules/fundamental-ui/dist/fundamental-ui.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />

### Standalone components
The components can be used without loading the whole library. Take a look at the individual files at:
