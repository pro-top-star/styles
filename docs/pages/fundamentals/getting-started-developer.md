<h2 class="docs-header-h2">The project</h2>
Techne 2.0 is a design system and pattern library package. This project packages the library for `npm` and generates the documentation as a static website.

We rely on several core technologies.

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (minimum v6.4)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
* Sass
* Nunjucks
* Ruby
* Bundle
* Jekyll

<h3 class="docs-header-h3">Install Gulp</h3>
In addition to Node, you must have Gulp installed globally:

`npm install -g gulp`

<h3 class="docs-header-h3">Install Gems</h3>
The following gems needs to be installed for the documentation site generation

`gem install ruby bundle jekyll`

<h3 class="docs-header-h3">Install dev dependencies</h3>

`npm install`

<h3 class="docs-header-h3">Serve it locally</h3>
The documentation website is served from the `docs/_site` directory which is generated by Jekyll. To generate and lunch the documentation site, simply execute the gulp command in terminal at the root of project directory.

`gulp`

<h3 class="docs-header-h3">Troubleshooting</h3>
