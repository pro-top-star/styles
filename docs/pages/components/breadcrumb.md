## Default Alert
Use to let people know there is something happening, but you can dismiss and act upon it later if needed, e.g. a service subscribed to needs updating. Itâ€™s recommended to use the dark blue treatment for Alerts. Alerts should display until they are dismissed by clicking or tapping X.
